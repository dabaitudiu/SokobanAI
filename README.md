## UC Irvine CS271 Sokoban AI

### Problem statement & Input format:
```
a. input is 5 lines defining the board :

   1.    sixeH sizeV, e.g. "3 5"
   2.    nWallSquares a list of coordinates of wall squares, e.g. "12 1 1 1 2 1 3 2 1 2 3 3 1 3 3 4 1 4 3 5 1 5 2 5 3"
   3.    nBoxes a list of coordinates of boxes, e.g. "1 3 2"
   4.    nStorageLocations a list of coordinates of storage locations, e.g. "1 4 2"
   5.    playerâ€™s initial location x and y, e.g. "2 2"

b. output is a single line, beginning with nMoves followed by a sequence of letters (U,D,L,R) indicating direction of the move, e.g. "1 D".
```

### Usage

#### 0. Directories Clarifications
- **SokobanSolver** is the final version that will be used in solving sokoban problems. This program concisely provides fastest computations and comparions using different algorithms.
- **SokobanBeta** is the test version which have newest test features. In this class, a ``MapGenerator`` Class, and ``CNN `` is used for exploration. However, the speed is affected and thus not used for actual.

#### 1. Helper Class: MapParser
- If you want to transfer a typical sokoban 2D map to a formal input, you can create an instance of this class
```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {
        parseMap("maps/your_map.txt");
}
```
- Your map should be in the form like the map below, where # stands for wall, $ for box, .for target, @ for player.
```
###########
#   ###   #
#   $  ## #
#      #  #
#    ######
#      #. #
#         #
# @  #    #
#####  $  #
# .       # 
###########
```


#### 2. Helper Class: MapGenerator
- To spawn sokoban maps in large numbers, I implemented this sokoban map generator. Its rough idea is to ask the player to define the number of walls, boxes, etc., and spawn these artifacts randomly on the map. Then it will run the fastest greedy algorithm to check whether this map is available. If a map is proved to be available, it will output the formal format to player assigned output file.
```java
    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {
        int n = 5; // number of instances you want to spawn.
        int start = 1; // filename start index
        int index = start;
        for (int i = start; i < n+start; i++) {
            String outputFile = String.format("file_%d.txt",i);
            MapGenerator generator = new MapGenerator(9,9,10,3,SEED,outputFile);
            generator.generate(20); // parameter here indicates the maximum times your program tries to avoid out of memory.
        }
}
```
